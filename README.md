# AfterEffectsExprTools
Amusing Expression in AfterEffects
## Background
This project uses Adobe AfterEffects(16.0+)`s new Javascript engine
> Chick Project Settings -> Expressions tab -> Change the JavaScript engine

Easier to make things like :
+ Extracting coordinates
+ Creating special shapes
+ Let Layer Pointer to sth
+ etc.

Hope they can be of substantial help to the workflow

Or just for fun
